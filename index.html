            <p>I am a computer science major and love technology. I am really excited to start classes for my major.</p>
            <p>I've always loved messing around coding games online and things like skratch. I cannot wait to learn to program and actually make things actually happen.</p>
            <p>I got marreid over Christmas break and i absolutely love it. We've both been members all our lives and both served missions. I served in Utah, and she served in Pennsylvania.</p>
